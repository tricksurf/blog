This is intended for people with some experience, but being that I myself am still learning I expect there to be some information helpful for a beginner as well.</p><h2>End Goal</h2><p>The end goal of this series of projects is going to be a simple internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafing_(video_games)#Bunny_hopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bunnyhopping</a> script. While it is a simple thing to implement, there are some basic concepts with it that can be applied to later endeavors. We will do this by detouring the function that the game uses to send movement commands, as well as reading networked variables to get the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/mp/src/public/const.h#L110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flags</a> of the player.</p><p>Networked variables are variables that are used to share information between the client and the server. We can access these ourselves to utilize information about our own player.</p><h2>Let's start</h2><p>I am going to skip past the part about creating a DLL and adding a function to interface the library with the game, as that should be easy to search or should already be understood by someone reading this blog.Â </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 24, 2023</p><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://tricksurf.github.io/blog/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://tricksurf.github.io/blog/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
